# Freebird SMP
### https://rudrecciah.dev/freebirdsmp
The Freebird SMP - V1 was a 1.16.5 SMP using Spigot.
All files I want to release as Open-Source and all files which make sense to be released to the public are in this directory.
To comply with copyright law, you have to build your own Spigot jar, although I do include a bash script to start the server.
